# tictactoe_challenge
a simple game of tic tac toe 

My primary goals in this challenge were to make a game that can be played easily from the keyboard and that isolates all DOM interaction from the underlying javascript game logic. Furthermore, I made sure the game was responsive enough to work on screens the size of phones.
