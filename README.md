# tictactoe_challenge

A simple game of tic tac toe 

My primary goals in this challenge were to make a game that can be played easily with a mouse or a keyboard and that isolates all DOM interaction from the underlying javascript game logic. I also made sure the game was responsive enough to work on small screens such as phones.
